# Adventure
A simple 2D game that I am making to focus on the interactive aspect of storytelling, my goal here is to learn how interactive fiction works in general, then maybe expand from here to improve the story telling methodology and the graphics.  

# Description
This is a game that tells the story of a young hero who is defending the world from a series of challenges. I am currently using the graphics provided by the arcade game library, which uses the OpenGL library implementation.
