# simple_Interactive_fiction_pygame
A simple 2D game that I am making to focus on the interactive aspect of storytelling, my goal here is to learn how interactive fiction works in general, then maybe expand from here to improve the story telling methodology and the graphics.  

# Description
This is a story about a young programmer who is defending himself from a series of obstacles.

# PyGame Library
PyGame is a Python library for gaming to deal with input, output functionality, and multimedia.


## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) to install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage
```python
import PyGame
```

## Roadmap
My first step is to create a window, and the objects appear on it. After that, I am going to add some of the dynamics of the gameplay. My third step, is going to be around developing the storytelling aspect, and the interactivity of the game itself. Fianlly, I am going to fix the issues within the game dynamics and release the first version.


## Project status
I just started working on couple of open-sourced projects, so I will be working on this game from time to time.
